**Impact of failure:** Failing these requirements means people can’t easily identify which government organisation is mainly accountable for the website or connect to the main NZ Government website.

**Related Web Usability Standard requirements:** [2.1 Home page](https://webtoolkit.govt.nz/standards/web-usability-standard/#home-page-links).

<div class="details" markdown="1">

### What information should be on the home page?

The Website’s home page must include:

* the name and/or logo of the New Zealand Government organisation primarily responsible for the Website.

* a visible link to newzealand.govt.nz or www.govt.nz.

If the website is a partnership between two or more organisations, government or non-government, it is recommended that each NZ Government organisation contributing to the website makes its participation clear by including its name and/or logo on the website’s home page.

Consistent with the [All-of-Government Brand Policy and Guidelines](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/govt-brand), organisations should use an appropriate version of the all-of-government brand image for the link.

### How to test

1.	Open the Website’s home page.
2.	Check that the name or logo of the responsible organisation is present on the home page. If it isn't, record a failure.
3. 	Check that a visible (image or text) link to newzealand.govt.nz or www.govt.nz is present on the home page. If it isn't, record a failure.
