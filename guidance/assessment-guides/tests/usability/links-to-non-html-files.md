#### What information should links to non-HTML files have?

When a web page includes a link to a non-HTML file (e.g. a video file), that link must be accompanied by information indicating the file’s format (e.g. mp4, PDF, MS Word) and size. 

Note that this requirement does not apply to such links on archived web pages.

#### How to test

1. Open the web page to be tested.

2. For each link to a non-HTML file, check that the file's format and size are indicated, e.g. [Getting a ship into a bottle (PDF, 1.3 MB)](#) or [Building model trains]() (MP4 463kB).
