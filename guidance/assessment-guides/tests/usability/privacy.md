**Impact of failure:** Failing these requirements means people can’t clearly determine exactly what personal or private information the website or responsible organisation collects, what it does with such information, and the users’ rights with regard to that information.

**Related Web Usability Standard requirements:** [2.4 Privacy](https://webtoolkit.govt.nz/standards/web-usability-standard/#privacy).

#### What are the privacy requirements?

Each website must have a privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”). The home page must include a visible link, called "Privacy policy" or something similarly unambiguous, to the Privacy Statement.

The Privacy Statement needs to include several bits of information:

* the information and website that the privacy statement applies to (e.g. "This privacy notice applies to personal information collected on [the organisation’s] website: ministry.govt.nz");

* how and where on the site a visitor’s personal information is collected;

* the organisations and/or third parties that keep the information;

* if a user has a choice in whether or not such information is collected;

* how collected personal information may be used by the organisation;

* the circumstances under which the information may be disclosed to others;

* what statistical information (including users’ IP addresses) is collected and how it is used;

* if cookies are used, a statement that this is so, and a brief description of what the cookies are used for;

* what rights users have to request access to or to correct the personal information that is being held by the organisation; and,

* the contact details for making such requests.

#### How to test

1. Check that a visible link to a "Privacy Statement" is present on the home page, and that it is clear from the link’s text that its target is the Privacy Statement for the Website. If there is such a link, skip to step 3. Otherwise, record a failure, noting the reason.

2. Review the website. Check that the website includes a link to a web page that provides a statement about the website’s collection and management of personal or private information. Note: This check may require some familiarity with the Website. If the site doesn't link to such a page, record a failure, noting the reasson, and move on to the next test.

3. Check that the Privacy Statement clearly indicates all of the following, and otherwise record a failure, noting the reason:

	* the scope of the statement (e.g. “This privacy notice applies to personal information collected on [the organisation’s] website: ministry.govt.nz.”)

	* the scope of the statement and that it applies to the website (e.g. “This privacy notice applies to personal information collected on ministry.govt.nz and agency.govt.nz.”)

	* the circumstances in which personal information is collected, by whom it is held (e.g. the responsible organisation and/or third parties) and any choices users have as to whether such information is collected in the first place

	* the uses to which collected personal information may be put by the collecting organisation and the circumstances in which it may be disclosed

	* the collection and use of statistical information, including users’ IP addresses

	* a statement that cookies are used, if that is the case, and a brief description of their purpose

	* users’ rights to request access to or to correct personal information held by the collecting organisation, and,

	* contact details for such purposes.
